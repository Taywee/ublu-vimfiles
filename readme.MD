-# Install
-
-```sh
-make install
-```
-
-Do not run the installation as root.  It will install into ~/.vim.  If you don't have a ~/.vim (like you are on windows), use VIMHOME to point to your home vim install:
-
-```sh
-make VIMHOME=/vimfiles install
-```
-
-# Uninstall
-
-```sh
-make uninstall
-```
